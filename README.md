Hello,
This was one of my project that i've been working on along with the instructur on an online course, 
which where i've learned and become familiar with so many new components and hooks, icluding: 
-AsyncStorage
-switchNavigator
-BottomTabNavigator
-useCallback
-use: MapView, Polyline and Circle from (react-native-maps) // components to deal with maps
-requestPermissionsAsync, watchPositionAsync and Accuracy from (expo-location) //request permission to track location
-SafeAreaView 
-useIsFocused // hook the returns a boolean to check if the screen is focused or not
-react-native-elements // UI library
